RL for Pok√©mon Battling
========================================================================

**Experiment1.py** - investigating the effects of changing policy on RL agent effectiveness
* Simple RL agent implementation with a state embedder and reward computation
* Tested 3 policies: Greedy Q Policy, Epsilon Greedy Q Policy, Boltzmann Q Policy

**Experiment2.py** - policy Hyperparameter Tuning

**Experiment3.py** - Round Robin for the optimal agent based on the player it was trained against

**Experiment4.py** - Round Robin with Minimax Algorithm

**Experiment5.py** - (in progress) PPO experiment
